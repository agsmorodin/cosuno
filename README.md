Repository contains two apps:  backend and frontend.


TODO:

- consider using preact instead of react
- add component tests for backend
- cover unhappy paths in tests (BE,FE)
- improve test coverage in general,  right now we have only very minimal base cases
- add ci/cd pipeline
- consider splitting BE and FE into separate repositories, they have to be maintained separately
- add logging to BE (high priority)/FE
